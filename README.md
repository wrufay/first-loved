## bible app, reinvented.

**introducing your new bible study buddy.**
no more clunky features that get in the way of the word, just search a verse and get exactly what you want.
featuring:

- a biblical ai chatbot powered by claude 4.5 opus for easy context searching, clarifications or definitions right **_on the spot_**
- login to make an account and **_save verses_** with or without notes, easily visible in the sidebar **_organized_** by book name
- **_four different bible translations_** to suit your needs, with quick fetching and **_simple ui_**, allowing you to focus on the content rather than distractions.

**tech stack:**

- made purely using **_python_** with the **_streamlit_** framework.
- **apis and databases:** this app uses Claude API, supabase, and bible api from https://bible-api.com
- deployed on **_render_** using **_docker_** to package the app.

no more jumping around, navigating through a sea of google tabs during your daily bible study. one stop, dailybread.

**how to use (to supplement your bible studies)**

1. visit https://dailybread.streamlit.app
2. wake up the app if it's asleep
3. open up your irl bible
4. search up the passage you're studying
5. whenever you run into something that confuses you or a word you dont know - simply ask the chat! it knows what passage you're looking at, so you dont need to feed it context. simply ask "what does ... mean?"
6. use the link provided for enduring word bible commentary for detailed real life explanations
7. create an account / log in to save your passages and notes for easy access

it's that simple! reducing the friction to open your bible -> get more out of the word of God.
no more having to open a million tabs, and more of making this habit easier.
