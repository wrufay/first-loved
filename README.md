### bible app, reinvented.

**_introducing your new bible study buddy._**
no more clunky features that get in the way of the word, just search a verse and get exactly what you want.
featuring:

- a biblical ai chatbot powered by gpt 3.5 turbo for easy context searching, clarifications or definitions right **_on the spot_**
- login to make an account and **_save verses_** with or without notes, easily visible in the sidebar **_organized_** by book name
- **_four different bible translations_** to suit your needs, with quick fetching and **_simple ui_**, allowing you to focus on the content rather than distractions.

**_tech stack:_**
made purely using python with the streamlit framework. also uses openai API, supabase, and bible api from https://bible-api.com

no more jumping around, navigating through a sea of google tabs during your daily bible study. one stop, dailybread.

**_how to use (to supplement your bible studies)_**

1. visit https://dailybread.streamlit.app
2. wake up the app if it's asleep
3. open up your irl bible (yup, this is meant to supplement, not replace!)
4. search up the passage you're studying (detailed search instructions in the sidebar)
5. whenever you run into something that confuses you or a word you dont know - simply ask the chat! it knows what passage you're looking at, so you dont need to feed it context, simply ask "what does ... mean?"
6. use the link provided for enduring word bible commentary for detailed real life explanations - can't rely on ai :)
7. (optional) create an account / log in to save your passages and notes for easy access

it's that simple! reducing the friction to open your bible -> get more out of the word of God.
no more feeling like you won't understand a single thing (which is okay btw), or feeling like you have to open a million tabs, and more of making this habit easier.
